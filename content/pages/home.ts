    items: [
      {
        question: "How are your leads different from shared leads?",
        answer: "Our leads are 100% exclusive to you. Unlike shared leads where multiple companies compete for the same homeowner, you're the only one receiving each lead. This means higher conversion rates and better ROI since you’re not racing against competitors."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes a lead 'pre-qualified'?",
        answer: "We verify that each homeowner is interested in selling, confirm their details, and ensure they aren’t already working with another company. Every lead is vetted for intent so you’re only paying for interested homeowners."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there really any contracts?",
        answer: "No contracts required. You only pay per lead, and you can pause or cancel your campaign anytime through our client portal. Scale up when you want more listings or pause when your pipeline is full — it’s completely flexible."
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly will I start receiving leads?",
        answer: "Once your campaign is set up (usually within 24-48 hours), seller leads begin flowing automatically. You'll receive instant notifications via SMS and email when a new lead comes in, so you can reach out while they’re actively interested in your services."
      },
      {
        question: "What areas can you target?",
        answer: "We provide leads in your target zip codes. During setup, you choose the areas you want to focus on, and we’ll only send you leads from those specific locations where you want more leads."
      },
      {
        question: "If I receive a bad lead, I get a replacement?",
        answer: "We stand behind our lead quality. If you receive a lead that doesn’t meet our pre-qualification standards, contact our support team and we’ll issue a credit. We also provide training resources to help you maximize your conversion from leads into deals."
